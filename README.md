# Hi, I'm Chloe, AKA Jinxed Quinn üê∫


Since October 2023, I started my dev life.

I used to with children, and now I work with a MacBook and way too much coffee, or sometimes an Energy Drink.

I learned all the stuff I know in [Ada Tech School](https://adatechschool.fr).

* üåç  I'm based in France
* üñ•Ô∏è  See my portfolio at [this link in building for now...](/) And you can contact me on it !
* üöÄ  I'm currently working on a great football website which is called [Pride Score](/), and I really want this project to work.
* üß†  I'm learning React, NextJS, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and I'm trying to be a full-satck developper.
* ü§ù  I'm open to collaborating on both front and back end projects with creative aspects.
